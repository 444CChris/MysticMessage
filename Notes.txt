##### Asymetric Encryption

    - Diffe-Hellman
        - Each person has a known public key and a secret key
            - The public key is established at the start of the encryption history over an insecure channel
            - The secret keys are assigned at the start of the encyrption history. 
                - One person decides on a key, and sends the other data calculated by encrypting their private key with the agreed public keys.
        - They use the known public key with their secret key to encrypt the message. When they send it over, the receiver can 
          use their secret key to decrypt the message. 
        - Not the most secure as it's vulnerable to man in the middle attacks. It should in theory be secure but doesn't encompass other parts of 
          encryption security. 

    - Elliptic curve diffie-hellman
        - Same idea as diffe hellman, but instead of using modulus it uses vector addition to encrypt and decrypt
        - First both senders generate private keys and then agree upon an arbitrary point over an insecure channel.
        - The public keys are generated by doing a dot product of the base point of the arbitrary point as a vector and the private keys that were generated. 
        - The public keys are exchanged, and now both parties can do vector calculations to decrypt and encrypt data according to their public private pairs. 
        - Generally better than diffe-hellman because it's harder for computers to automate vector computations, and this method of encryption is faster and 
          takes up less space because the basic arithmetic is less than that of traditional Diffe-Hellman with modulus. 

    - LWE 
        - 

    -RSA
        - Slowwww
        - mainly used to transport symmetric keys which are faster.
